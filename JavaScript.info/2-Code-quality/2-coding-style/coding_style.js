// Coding Style

/**
 * Our code must be as clean and easy to read as possible
 * 
 * That is actually the art of programming â€“ to take a complex task and code it 
 * in a way that is both correct and human-readable. A good code style greatly 
 * assists in that.

// ======================== Syntax ========================//

// Here is a cheat sheet with some suggested rules (see below for more details):

/**
 *               function pow(x, n) {
 *                 let result = 1;
 * 
 *                 for (let i = 0)
 *              }
