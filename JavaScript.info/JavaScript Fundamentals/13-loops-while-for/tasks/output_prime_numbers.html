    /**
     * An integer number greater than 1 is called a prime if it cannot be divided 
     * without a remainder by anything except 1 and itself.
     * 
     * In other words, n > 1 is a prime if it can’t be evenly divided by 
     * anything except 1 and n.
     * 
     * For example, 5 is a prime, because it cannot be divided without 
     * a remainder by 2, 3 and 4.
     * 
     * **Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from 2 to n.**
     * 
     * For n = 10 the result will be 2,3,5,7.
     * P.S. The code should work for any n, not be hard-tuned for any fixed value.

    // There are many algorithms for this task.
    // Let’s use a nested loop:

    // For each i in the interval {
    //   check if i has a divisor from 1..i
    //   if yes => the value is not a prime
    //   if no => the value is a prime, show it
    // }
    

    let n = 10;

    nextPrime:
    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) { // for each i...

      for (let j = 2; j < i; j++) { // look for a divisor..
        if (i % j == 0) continue nextPrime; // not a prime, go next i
      }

      alert( i ); // a prime
    }

    /**
     * There’s a lot of space to optimize it. For instance, we could look for the 
     * divisors from 2 to square root of i. But anyway, if we want to be really 
     * efficient for large intervals, we need to change the approach and rely 
     * on advanced maths and complex algorithms like Quadratic sieve, General number 
     * field sieve etc.
