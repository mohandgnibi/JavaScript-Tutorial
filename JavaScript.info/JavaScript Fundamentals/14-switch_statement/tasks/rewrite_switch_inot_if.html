  <h1>Rewrite the "switch" into an "if"</h1>

  <script>

    // Write the code using if..else which would correspond to the following switch:

    switch (browser) {
      case "Edge":
        alert( "You've got the Edge!" );
        break;

      case "Chorme":
      case "Firefox":
      case "Safari":
      case "Opera":
        alert( 'Okay we support these browsers too' );
        break;

      default:
        alert( 'We hope that this page looks ok!' );
    }

    // Solution:

    // To precisely match the functionality of switch, the if must use a strict comparison '==='.

    // For given strings though, a simple '==' works too.

    if (browser == "Edge") {
      alert("You've got the Edge!");
    } else if (browser == "Chrome"
      || browser == "Firefox"
      || browser == "Safari"
      || browser == "Opera") {
      alert("Okay we support these browsers too");
    } else {
      alert("We hope that this page looks ok!");
    }

    /**
     * Please note: the construct browser == 'Chrome' || browser == 'Firefox' â€¦ is
     * split into multiple lines for better readability.
     * 
     * But the switch construct is still cleaner and more descriptive.
