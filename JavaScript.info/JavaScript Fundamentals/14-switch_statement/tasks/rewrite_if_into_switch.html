  <h1>Rewrite "if" into "switch"</h1>

  <script>

    // Rewrite the code below using a single switch statement:

    let a = +prompt('a?', '');

    if (a == 0) {
      alert(0)
    }

    if (a == 1) {
      alert(1);
    }

    if (a == 2 || a == 3) {
      alert('2, 3');
    }

    // Solution:

    // The first two checks turn into two case. The third check is split into two cases:

    switch (a) {
      case 0:
        alert( 0 );
        break;

      case 1:
        alert( 1 );
        break;

      case 2:
      case 3: 
        alert( '2,3' );
        break;
    }

    /**
     * Please note: the break at the bottom is not required. But we put it to make 
     * the code future-proof.
     * 
     * In the future, there is a chance that we’d want to add one more case, 
     * for example case 4. And if we forget to add a break before it, 
     * at the end of case 3, there will be an error. So that’s a kind of self-insurance.
