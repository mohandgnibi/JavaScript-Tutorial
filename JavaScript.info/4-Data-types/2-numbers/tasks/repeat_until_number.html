    // Repeat until the input is a number

    /*
    Create a function 'readNumber' which prompts for a number until the visitor 
    enters a valid numeric value.

    The resulting value must be returned as a number.

    The visitor can also stop the process by entering an empty line or 
    pressing “CANCEL”. In that case, the function should return 'null'.
    */

    // Solution

    function readNumber() {
      let num;

      do {
        num = prompt("Enter a number please?", 0);
      } while ( !isFinite(num) );

      if (num === null || num === '') return null;

      return +num;
    }

    alert(`Read: ${readNumber()}`);

    /*
    The solution is a little bit more intricate that it could be because we need 
    to handle 'null'/empty lines.

    So we actually accept the input until it is a “regular number”. Both 'null' (cancel) 
    and empty line also fit that condition, because in numeric form they are 0.

    After we stopped, we need to treat 'null' and empty line specially (return 'null'), 
    because converting them to a number would return '0'.
