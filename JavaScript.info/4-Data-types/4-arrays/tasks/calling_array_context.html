  <h1>Calling in an array context</h1>

  <script>
    
    // Calling in an array context

    // What is the result? Why?

    let arr = ["a", "b"];

    arr.push(function() {
      alert( this )
    });

    arr[2](); // ?

    // Solution:

    /*
    The call arr[2]() is syntactically the good old obj[method](), in the role 
    of obj we have arr, and in the role of method we have 2.

    So we have a call of the function arr[2] as an object method. Naturally, it 
    receives this referencing the object arr and outputs the array:

    let arr = ["a", "b"];

    arr.push(function() {
      alert( this );
    });

    arr[2](); // a,b,function(){...}

    The array has 3 values: initially it had two, plus the function.
