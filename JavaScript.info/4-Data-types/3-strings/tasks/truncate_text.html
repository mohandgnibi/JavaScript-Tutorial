  <h1>Truncate the text</h1>

  <script>
    /*
    Create a function truncate(str, maxlength) that checks the length of the str 
    and, if it exceeds maxlength – replaces the end of str with the ellipsis 
    character "…", to make its length equal to maxlength.

    The result of the function should be the truncated (if needed) string.

    For instance:

    truncate("What I'd like to tell on this topic is:", 20) == "What I'd like to te…"
    truncate("Hi everyone!", 20) == "Hi everyone!"
    */

    // Solution

    /*
    The maximal length must be maxlength, so we need to cut it a little shorter, 
    to give space for the ellipsis.

    Note that there is actually a single Unicode character for an ellipsis. That’s 
    not three dots.
    */



    function truncate(str, maxlength) {
      return (str.length > maxlength) ?
        str.slice(0, maxlength - 1) + '...' : str;
    }

    alert(truncate("What I'd like to tell on this topic is:", 20));
    alert(truncate("Hi everyone!", 20));
