     * greater than 100 or cancels the input/enters an empty line.

     * The loop do..while repeats while both checks are truthy:
     * 
     * 1. The check for num <= 100 – that is, the entered value 
     *    is still not greater than 100.
     * 2. The check && num is false when num is null or an empty string. 
     *    Then the while loop stops too.
     * 
     * P.S. If num is null then num <= 100 is true, so without the 2nd check the loop 
     * wouldn’t stop if the user clicks CANCEL. Both checks are required.
